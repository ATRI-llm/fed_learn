# Federated Learning Project

This project simulates federated learning over loan approval data using TensorFlow, numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.  
It is modular, extendable, and can scale to additional clients and larger datasets.

## Usage

1. We are planning to make it to show how different aggregation technique work in FedLearn.
2. We will try to switch between different datasets to showcast its potencial in different domain.
3. Our main goal will be to bring it as close as possible to a model of same architecture trained over entire dataset.
